To use Valgrind, run "valgrind ./programToRun arg1 arg2". Look at the output. If it recommends that you rerun valgrind with additional options, consider doing so.

Besides running valgrind as described above, the next most common way to do it is to run: "valgrind --leak-check=full ./programToRun arg1 arg2".

If Valgrind shows a PROBLEM INSIDE OF A FUNCTION THAT YOU DID NOT WRITE, then there are two possibilities:

(1) Valgrind thinks there is a bug in the function that you are calling. If you think this might be the case, try an Internet search to see if you can confirm that other people are getting the same message or if it has been reported as a bug with the appropriate projects. For simple programs, this possibility is unlikely. For complex programs (those that use graphical toolkits, 3D graphics, etc), it is possible that valgrind errors/warnings will appear even if you have done nothing wrong.

(2) You are calling the function in an incorrect way. In this case, ignore the specific details of the Valgrind message and focus on making sure that you are correctly using the function. Make sure that all of the parameters you are passing the function are correct.

If Valgrind shows you a PROBLEM IN ONE OF YOUR FUNCTIONS, then Valgrind's description of the problem is usually accurate.
