You can use "#define _FORTIFY_SOURCE 1" in your C code or use "-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1"  with GCC to enable additional buffer overflow checks. Some of the checks are identified at runtime and others are flagged as warnings at compile-time. These checks may not be turned on unless you also use -O1 or -O2 optimization.

You can also set _FORTIFY_SOURCE to 2 for additional checks, but you might get some false positives.

NOTE: On some Ubuntu machines, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 is set by default but is only activated when optimization is set to -O2.

Also see the manual for gcc: "man gcc"
