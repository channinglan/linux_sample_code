To use GDB to determine where your code is crashing:

Compile your program with the "-g" flag.

./gdb --args ./myProgramToRun arg1 arg2

At the gdb prompt, type "run"

When the program crashes, type "bt"

Type "quit" to finish using gdb.


=== Core dump files ===
If your program left a core dump file after it crashed, you can use the resulting core file to debug what happened. See the core-dump.c example program for a demonstration of how this works.
