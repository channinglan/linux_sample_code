These programs are compiled using -std=c99 to compile ISO C programs. However, some examples use POSIX C features. There are at least two ways to enable such features:

 - You can enable POSIX C and other features by compiling with -std=c99 and then also including "#define _GNU_SOURCE" at the top of your code (or setting that variable with a parameter passed to gcc).

- You can also use -std=gnu99 to enable additional features beyond C99.

For a full description of what the preprocessor variables mean, run "man feature_test_macros".
