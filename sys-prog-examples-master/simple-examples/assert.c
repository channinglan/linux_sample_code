/* assert() is implemented in the C preprocessor.

   Compile with -DNDEBUG or use "#define NDEBUG" to make assert() do
   nothing. For example, when you are developing a piece of software,
   you might use many, many asserts()---and to get a little bit of
   extra performance out of your program, you might decide to disable
   them. Some production programs ship with assertions turned on! */

	// Any expressions inside of assert() should be true. If they are
	// false, we will exit with an error message indicating the file
	// and line number that the problem occurred at.

	// try this:

	// variable, call a function that changes the state of your
	// program). If your assert() call changes the state of your
	// program, compiling with assert() turned off will change the
	// behavior of your program.
