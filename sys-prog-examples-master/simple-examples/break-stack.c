// Your stack has a limit to what it grow to. This program tries to
// allocate a huge amount of space on the stack, causing the program
// to crash.
//
// Run "ulimit -a", "limit", "limits" from the command-line to see the
// maximum stack size allowed.
//
// You can avoid this problem by allocating large amounts of space on
// the heap (with malloc()) or using Making the large array a global
// (or static) variable may also work---since they aren't allocated on
// the stack.

//	static char array[1024*1024*1024]; // works
