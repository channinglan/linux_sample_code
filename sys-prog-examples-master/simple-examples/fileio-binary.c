	   "+" allows us to read too.
	   
	   "b" says that we are writing bindary data (instead of text
	   data). This flag isn't used by POSIX-compliant systems like
	   Linux. On non-POSIX systems, the C programming language might
	   translate '\n' into the appropriate newline character for your
	   particular operating system. This translation process is
	   disabled when a file is opened in binary mode. On POSIX
	   systems, the '\n' character is the newline character, so no
	   translation is necessary.
