  Many functions in C return a special value if an error
  occurred. However, many functions also set a variable called "errno"
  that contains detailed information about exactly what the error
  is. For example, open() will return -1 if an error occurs. If you
  want to identify the exact error, you can look at the errno
  variable. "man 2 open" indicates that it could be set to EACCES,
  EEXIST, EFAULT, EFBIG, EINTR, etc. To convert an errno integer into
  a human-readable string, use strerror() or perror().

  Each errno can be interpreted several different ways:
  - The errno itself is an integer.

  - There are preprocessor macros/variable names so you don't have to
    remember the numbers (EACCESS, EEXIST, etc). For a list of these,
    see "man 3 errno". It is best to rely on these variable names 
    instead of the integer values themselves because different machines
    may use different integers for the same error.

  - The macro/variable names can also be mapped to a human readable
    message. These messages are also listed in "man 3 errno". These
    are the messages that perror() or strerror() print out.

  To get a quick idea of how the integers map to the variable names on
  your computer, try running:
  cpp -dM /usr/include/errno.h | grep 'define E' | sort -n -k 3
  // From: http://stackoverflow.com/a/503920/474549

  If you are running Ubuntu, you can install the "errno" package using
  the package manager and then run "errno -l" and get a list of the
  variables, integers, and strings.

  On my Linux machine, /usr/include/errno.h includes
  /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/errno.h which includes
  /usr/include/linux/errno.h which includes /usr/include/asm/errno.h
  which includes /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/errno.h which
  includes /usr/include/asm-generic/errno.h (includes some error
  codes 35-133) which includes /usr/include/asm-generic/errno-base.h
  (includes error codes 1-34).

 Using "extern" is one way to get access to the errno

int main(void)

	int fd = open("/this/does/not/exist", O_RDONLY, 0644 );

	// errno is set to 0 ("success") when the program begins. Many functions
	// will *not* set it to 0 if successful (although some
	// might). For one description of the reasoning behind this, see:
	// http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/209729/
	perror("Perror1");
	fd = open("/dev/null", O_WRONLY, 0644 );
	if(fd > 0)

		perror("Perror2"); //open() might not set errno back to success!
	}

	// You can assign values to errno in a thread-safe way:
	// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694164/is-errno-thread-safe
	errno = 1;
	perror("Perror3");

	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
