	/* Another note: Using a union of a float and an int is different
	   than simply casting a float to an int (and vice versa). For
	   example, if you assign an int 5 to a float, the float would
	   then contain 5.0. The integer 5 and the floating point number 5
	   are stored differently. Therefore, the bits in the integer 5
	   and the floating point number 5 are different from each other.
