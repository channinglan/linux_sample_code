1. lttng list --kernel
Before tracing, you need to create a session:

2. sudo lttng create my-session
Tip:You can avoid using sudo in the previous and following commands if your user is a member of the tracing group.
my-session is the tracing session name and could be anything you like. auto will be used if omitted.
Let's now enable some events for this session:
sudo lttng enable-event --kernel sched_switch,sched_process_fork
or you might want to simply enable all available kernel events (beware that trace files will grow rapidly when doing this):

3. sudo lttng enable-event --kernel --all

Start tracing:
4. sudo lttng start
By default, traces are saved in ~/lttng-traces/name-date-time, where name is the session name.


5. When you're done tracing:
sudo lttng stop
sudo lttng destroy
