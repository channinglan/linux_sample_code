 *
 * \section intro Presentation
 *
 * This API can  be used to create clients for LCDproc server.
 *  It contains a set of C++ classes for each widgets.
 *
 * \section classes Classes
 *
 * The class that must be used for all programms is LCDClient as it contains everything
 * to connect to the server.
 * 
 * You'll probably also need LCDScreen to create a new screen to be displayed.
 * 
 * To learn more about all the classes, consult the <a href="modules.html">Modules section</a>.
 *
 * \section install Installation
 *
 * You can get the source from the following link:
 *
 * ftp://ftp2.c-sait.net/csait/lcdapi-0.2.tar.gz
 *
 * You can then unpack them with:
 * \code
 * tar zxf lcdapi-0.2.tar.gz
 * \endcode
 * Go into the new directory and type:
 * \code
 * make
 * \endcode
 * You will then have the liblcdapi.so library in the lib directory.
 *
 * \section use Usage
 *
 * To use this library, you have to include only one file, LCDHeaders.h as it
 *  includes all the other files.
 *
 * Your program must be linked with the socket and the pthread libraries.
 *
 * To compile client.cpp for example, you should use these commands on a GNU/Linux system:
 * \code
 * export LCD_API_DIR=/where/LCD_API/is
 * export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LCD_API_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * g++ -o client client.cpp -I$LCD_API_DIR/include -L$LCD_API_DIR/lib -llcdapi -lpthread
 * \endcode
 * There may have some differences on other systems.
 *  For example you must add -lsocket on Solaris.
 *
 * \section example Example
 *
 * You can find in the <a href="examples.html">examples page</a> some example of programms using the API.
 *

/**
 * \example client.cpp
 * A small example of what can be done.
 *
 * It creates 3 screens, each one being displayed 2 seconds.
 * <ul>
 *  <li> First screen contains a title and the name of the current playing song with notun or kscd.</li>
 *  <li> Second screen contains time of the day displayed with big numbers.</li>
 *  <li> Third screen contains a title, a bar representing CPU usage and the textual value.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * It also uses callback for keys.
 *
 * The one for B key is defined using LCD_CALLBACK_FUNCTION_* macros. They are useful if you only want a function whithout parameter to be excuted.
 *
 * For the A key, the callback is in a TitleSwitcher class because it needs more parameters. It will switch from English to French title for first screen.
