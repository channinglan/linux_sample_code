A good way to quickly start using TOPPERS/SafeG is to execute it on the QEMU
emulator.

We suggest following these steps:

    1.- Make sure you have read the document 'introduction.txt' and you
        understand the basic idea of SafeG. You can find more information
        on the 'references.txt' file.

    2.- Build and execute SafeG for the QEMU vexpress A9 target. The
        documentation is located at 'doc/en/target/vexpressa9/README.txt'.
        Follow all the steps until you succesfuly execute SafeG.

If you have any problems running SafeG on the QEMU, follow the instructions
at section "IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG" on 'introduction.txt'.
