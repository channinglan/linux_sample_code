Debugging TOPPERS/SafeG is usually done by one of these methods:

 1) Serial output: the SafeG monitor can output debug messages during
    execution (see monitor/common/debug.h).

 2) JTAG: this is usually done by using an external device (ICE) connected
    to the target board, and allows step-by-step execution. Debugging
    scripts for each target board are included in the 'patches/target'
    directory.

 3) QEMU GDB: QEMU targets allow debugging the code of SafeG by connecting
    a gdb client to QEMU internal gdb server.
