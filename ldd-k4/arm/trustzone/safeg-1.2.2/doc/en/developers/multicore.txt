When TOPPERS/SafeG is executed on a multicore processor, the monitor code
is shared by all cores.

During the SafeG's monitor initialization a set of barriers are used to
synchronize with the so-called primary core. Afterwards, the execution of
the SafeG monitor is independent of the core.

The sp_mon register at each core contains the pointer to the stack or T
context switch of that core.

System calls and notifiers are always executed in the same core where they
are triggered.

SafeG monitor does not use any locks. A consequence is that registered
notifiers and dynamic system calls cannot be unregistered.

A configuration where some cores are set as T and other cores are set as NT
is possible. However, that could be achieved with a simpler code than SafeG.
